My project mimics a Hotel Reservation system. My goal is to have a user be able to reserve a room.

My initial Database Schema:

A customer would be able to make a reservation to hotels(implying many locations). I decided to simplify this idea and remove the reservation and hotel tables meaning that the customer can book a room at this specific hotel.

The updated Database Schema:
